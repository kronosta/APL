‡ - U+2021 - Sub Array
    ⍵ should be the array to take elements from
    ⍺ should be a 2-row matrix with ≢ ⍴⍵ columns
        row 1 should be 1-based indexes to start
        row 2 should be the shape of the sub-array
    Returns a subarray of ⍵ according to ⍺

    This is a separate operator because I'm confused on what the ⌷ operator in dzaima/APL actually does.
